            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800">Stick to a routine</h3>
            <p>The bipolar brain thrives with routine: consistency in waking time, eating habits, work schedule, and sleep hygiene. When your brain knows what it is doing next, it’s not as stressed out, which leaves more room to figure out problems and handle other frustrations.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800">Get consistent sleep</h3>
            <p>Sleep is the most effective thing you can do to prevent mania and keep your bipolar in check. Multiple studies have demonstrated the relationship between sleep deprivation and the risk of mania and hypomania. However, people with depression and bipolar often feel best at night so they want to stay up and compose their masterpiece or write their bestselling novel. The trick is going to bed when the rush of creativity comes, to practice good sleep hygiene when you don’t want to.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800">Sweat</h3>
            <p>Back in 400 B.C., Hippocrates wrote, “Eating alone will not keep a man well. He must also exercise.” In the past, scientists have focused on the benefits of exercise for the heart, muscles, lungs, and bones. New research is focusing on how it improves the brain: less depression, better memory, and quicker learning. Studies indicate that exercise may be an effective strategy to deal with the depressive phase of bipolar disorder.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800">Eat a healthy diet</h3>
            <p>There is an undeniable link between food and mood. For optimal mood, eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and limit your fat and sugar intake. Space your meals out through the day, so your blood sugar never dips too low. High-carbohydrate diets can cause mood crashes, so they should also be avoided. Other mood-damaging foods include chocolate, caffeine, and processed foods.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800">Laugh</h3>
            <p>Charlie Chaplin once said, “To truly laugh, you must be able to take your pain and play with it.” I suppose that’s why talented comedians like Stephen Colbert, Art Buchwald, Robin Williams, and Ben Stiller have journeyed through periods of torment. There is an unspoken message hidden within a giggle that says this: “I promise, you’ll get through this.” Research suggests laughter therapy can reverse the stress response, alter dopamine and serotonin levels, and facilitate healing.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800">Avoid alcohol and drugs</h3>
            <p>Drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, and amphetamines can trigger mania, while alcohol and tranquilizers can trigger depression. Even moderate social drinking can upset your emotional balance. Substance use also interferes with sleep and may cause dangerous interactions with your medications. Attempts to self-medicate or numb your symptoms with drugs and alcohol only create more problems.</p>
